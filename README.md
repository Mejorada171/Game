# Overview

This program is helping me to undersatand a little bit more about the C# programming langueges and how we can use it to build amazing games, I know that to be a good software engineer we
should understand most of the programming languages and be able to find solutions to certain problems.

The program I wrote is a Text Adventure Game, this game allows the user to go trough a history and make choices about it, each decision could change the path of the adventure, in this program
we attempt to provide an entretainment and an interesting story that trap the attention's user in the program. 

I write this program to learn more a bout C#, how it works and how we could build amazing projects, I like to think that this programs would be the base of some greater programs in my carrer,
there are times when I struggle with something in anew project and looking back to some last projects I made helped to undersatnd and fix the mistakes.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I try to add more lines of code to make the history a little bit longer.
- I would like to make the program more interactive maybe more questions and funny things to make in the program. 
- I guess I should use more classes on the program as well.
